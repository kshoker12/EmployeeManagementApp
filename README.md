# EmployeeManagementApp
An app used to manage employee schedules and their salaries, as well as the stores earnings to optimize time management and keep store organized. 

**What does Application do?**

This application is intended to have multiple useful features which allow the employer to operate the store at a high level. The employee menu allows employer to hire new employees who have a name, hourly salary, and number of hours available per week, as well as fire currently working employees. Each employee's name, weekly salary, total salary, number of hours worked in current week, hourly wage, and weekly schedules can all be viewed by clicking on the employee list and the hourly wage and weekly schedule can be edited at any given moment by the employee. There is also an "Open Store" button in the main menu which opens the store and displays the currently scheduled employees on the east panel of the app and also displays the current day of the week and current time. The "Increment Hour" button increments the current time and updates the currently scheduled employees according to the time. The "Close Store" button clears the currently working employees and updates the current day. If it's Sunday the employees are through the weekly earnings of the store and the remaining earnings are added to the store's total earnings. The "Add Daily Store Earnings" button allows employer to log daily earnings and add it to the weekly earnings of the store. 

**Who will use it?**

My employer at Coast Meridian Hardware will use this app and this can also be used by other store employers who wish to manage their store in an organized manner.

**Why is this of interest to me?**

This project was of interest to me because this allowed me to help my employer to optimize her time management because this app is intended to conduct all the time-consuming tasks for her so she can focus on other things. This app also allowed me to utilize and refine my software developing skills and put it to good to use.

**Future Improvements**

For the future, I want to add a feature which will allow the employer to view the store's inventory of products and each product has a name, cost, and quantity available which will allow employer to manage the products in an organized manner because this can be a tedious task. Another feature that interests me is tracking a list of online orders which has a customers name, the products they want and the quantity of each product, the total cost of the order and a status of whether its been delivered yet.
